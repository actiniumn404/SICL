# SICL
### Slightly Infuriating Coding Language.

SICL is an esoteric programming language designed and maintained by Andrew Chen (@Actiniumn404) which is designed to be slightly annoying. In short, SICL is just [AUL](https://github.com/actiniumn404/Annoyingly-Uncodeable-Language) but actually coded smartly. SICL is licensed under the MIT License. The official SICL compiler is written in Python, so if you want to use this language, please [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the CPython compiler.
