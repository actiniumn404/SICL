# SICL
### Slightly Infuriating Coding Language.

SICL is an esoteric programming language designed and maintained by Andrew Chen (@Actiniumn404) which is designed to be slightly annoying. In short, SICL is the second-generation of [AUL](https://github.com/actiniumn404/Annoyingly-Uncodeable-Language). Put simply, SICL is AUL but programmed smarter. (e.g. AUL does a manual character-by-character scan, while SICL utilizes regular expressions) 
### Credits and Licensing

Thank you to [Fyssion](https://github.com/Fyssion) for helping out with some code. If it wasn't for his help, the whole functions portion of this SICL would probably be dysfunctional!
